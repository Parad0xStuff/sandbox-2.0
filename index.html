			Sandbox 2.0.0
		</h1>
		<p id="introduction">
			Sandbox is an online tool for sketching and sharing chiptune melodies. It was based off of Modded BeepBox, which is a mod for BeepBox, an online tool for sketching and sharing chiptune melodies.<br/><br/>
			All song data is packaged into the URL at the top of your browser. When you make changes to the song, the URL is updated
			to reflect your changes. When you are satisfied with your song, just copy and paste the URL to save and share your song!<br/><br/>
			Looking for 1.x updates? Go <a href="https://parad0xstuff.github.io/sandbox">Here!</a>
		</p>
				<h1>
					Instructions
				</h1>
				<p>
					You can add or remove notes by clicking on the gray rows at the top. Sandbox automatically plays the notes out loud for you. Try it!<br/><br/>
					Notes go into patterns, and you can edit one pattern at a time. Those numbered boxes at the bottom of the editor are the
					different patterns you can edit. Click the other boxes to move to a different part of the song, or click the arrows
					on the currently selected box to swap which pattern is played during that part of the song.<br/><br/>
					There are four rows of patterns that SandBox can play simultaneously, and each row has its own set of patterns. The first
					three rows can play melodies and the bottom row is for "drums".<br/><br/>
					The purple loop underneath the numbered boxes controls which part of the song is currently repeating. Move the loop to listen
					to a different part of the song, or drag the ends to expand the loop to include the whole song.<br/><br/>
					When SandBox has focus (click on its interface above), you can use these keyboard shortcuts: <br/>
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left:50px;">
					Spacebar: Pause or Resume<br/> Z: Undo<br/> Y or Shift Z: Redo<br/> C: Copy the current pattern<br/> V: Paste the current
					pattern<br/> [ ]: Move the playhead backward and forward<br/> Arrow Keys: Change which bar is selected<br/> 1-8: Reassign
					a pattern to the currently selected bar<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					In the pattern editor, you can click and drag horizontally on a note to adjust its duration. You can also click above or
					below an existing note to enable a rapid arpeggio/trill effect, oscillating between two or more simultaneous notes.<br/><br/>
					ADVANCED: Drag vertically from an existing note to bend its pitch, or drag vertically from above or below the note to adjust
					its volume.<br/><br/>
					SandBox has many more features. Try playing with the buttons and menus on the right side to find out what it can do!<br/><br/>

					BeepBox is developed by <a href="http://www.johnnesky.com">John Nesky</a>, also known as <a href="https://twitter.com/shaktool">@shaktool</a>. SandBox is developed by Parad0xGamer and Fillygroove.<br/><br/>
					SandBox, Modded BeepBox, and BeepBox do not claim ownership over songs created with it, so original songs belong to their authors.<br/><br/>
					Neither John Nesky, BeepBox, or SandBox assume responsibility for any copyrighted material played on BeepBox. No songs are ever received,

					You can download <a href="BeepBoxOffline.swf">an offline Flash version of BeepBox</a> (right click and select "Save
					As...") to use when you don't have access to the internet. The features are otherwise the same. You can open BeepBoxOffline.swf
					in a browser tab to run it, or you can install a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html">Flash Projector</a> to run swf files without a browser.<br/><br/>
					You can download and use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/shaktool/beepbox">the source code</a> under the MIT license.
					In particular, you can use the synth code <a href="synth_example.html">as demonstrated here</a> to play BeepBox songs
					in your own Flash or JavaScript projects!
